# Alpha Vantage API Client

## API Overview

Simple python wrapper around alpha vantage api. This client implements production readiness
by storing your api key safely and a consistent data model from the api. 

- You can find alpha vantage api here: https://www.alphavantage.co/
- See the alpha vantage api documentation: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/
- Get your free api key here: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

**NOTE: Free API keys have a limit of 5 calls per min and max of 500 calls per day.**

## Notable Class Information

#### Base Fields

1. success (true/false) flag into your response. You can log response into splunk or cloudwatch and know when something
   fails.
2. limit_reached (true/false) flag into your response. You can know the difference between an error and reaching limit.
   so you can pause processing until you api key is allowed to make more requests.
3. error_message (str) is the response message from the api or this client with details on what went wrong and how to
   fix it.

#### GlobalQuote, Quote

1. data (dictionary) contains the information requested.
2. meta_data (dictionary) data describing the data requested.

#### AccountingReport

1. annualReports (list) contains the annual earnings or income statement data requested.
2. quarterlyReports (list) contains the quarterly earnings or income statement data requested.

#### CompanyOverview

All data from the company overview api
(example: https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo)
will yield a strongly typed object to include the based fields mentioned above.
**_Please Note_** some fields in this class have been renamed for clarity and to be more pythonic.

#### RealGDP

1. name (str)
2. interval (str)
3. unit (str)
4. data (list) GDP data requested

## Install from pip

```
pip install alphavantage_api_client
```

## Sample Usage Specifying Api Key in Client Builder

```
from alphavantage_api_client import AlphavantageClient

client = AlphavantageClient().with_api_key("[your api key here]")
event = {
   "symbol": "ibm",
   "interval": "5min"
}
global_quote = client.get_global_quote(event)
assert global_quote.success, "Success field is missing or False"
assert not global_quote.limit_reached, "Limit reached is true but not hitting API"
assert global_quote.symbol == event["symbol"], "Symbol from results don't match event"
assert "meta_data" not in global_quote, "Metadata should not be present since it's not in the api"
assert len(global_quote.data) > 0, "Data field is zero or not present"

print(f"Response data {global_quote.json()}")
```

## Sample Usage Specifying Api Key in request event

```
from alphavantage_api_client import AlphavantageClient

client = AlphavantageClient()
event = {
   "symbol": "ibm",
   "interval": "5min",
   "apikey" : "[your key here]"
}
global_quote = client.get_global_quote(event)
assert global_quote.success, "Success field is missing or False"
assert not global_quote.limit_reached, "Limit reached is true but not hitting API"
assert global_quote.symbol == event["symbol"], "Symbol from results don't match event"
assert "meta_data" not in global_quote, "Metadata should not be present since it's not in the api"
assert len(global_quote.data) > 0, "Data field is zero or not present"

print(f"Response data {global_quote.json()}")
```

## Sample Usage Specifying Api Key in ini file

#### On mac/linux based machines run the following command BUT use your own API KEY

```
echo -e "[access]\napi_key=[your key here]" > ~/.alphavantage
```

#### Now try the below

```
from alphavantage_api_client import AlphavantageClient

client = AlphavantageClient()
event = {
   "symbol": "ibm",
   "interval": "5min"
}
global_quote = client.get_global_quote(event)
assert global_quote.success, "Success field is missing or False"
assert not global_quote.limit_reached, "Limit reached is true but not hitting API"
assert global_quote.symbol == event["symbol"], "Symbol from results don't match event"
assert "meta_data" not in global_quote, "Metadata should not be present since it's not in the api"
assert len(global_quote.data) > 0, "Data field is zero or not present"

print(f"Response data {global_quote.json()}")
```

## Sample Usage Specifying API Key in environment variable

#### On mac/linux based machines run the following command BUT use your own API KEY

```
export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=[your key here]
```

#### Now try the below

```
from alphavantage_api_client import AlphavantageClient

client = AlphavantageClient()
event = {
   "symbol": "ibm",
   "interval": "5min"
}
global_quote = client.get_global_quote(event)
assert global_quote.success, "Success field is missing or False"
assert not global_quote.limit_reached, "Limit reached is true but not hitting API"
assert global_quote.symbol == event["symbol"], "Symbol from results don't match event"
assert "meta_data" not in global_quote, "Metadata should not be present since it's not in the api"
assert len(global_quote.data) > 0, "Data field is zero or not present"

print(f"Response data {global_quote.json()}")
```

### Any Other Data Available

See https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/
The event{} dictionary will contain the url parameters exactly as specified in the documentation. The response will include
the based fields and the exact response from the API. This is bypassing the normalization process, but might be useful
for you.

```
from alphavantage_api_client import AlphavantageClient
import json

# see section above to specify api key
#
event = {
    "function": "EMA"
}
client = AlphavantageClient()
results = client.get_data_from_alpha_vantage(event)
assert type(results) is dict, "Results object should be a dictionary"
assert len(results) > 0, "There should be data in the results"

print(f"json data{json.dumps(results)}")
```

## Debugging

We use the built in `import logging` library in python. Obtaining more information from the client behavior
is as simple as adjusting your log levels.

1. `logging.INFO` - This will get you json log statements (in case you put these into splunk or cloudwatch)
   that show which method is doing the work, the action, and the value or data is produced (where applicable).

   #### Example log showing where it found your API key

   ```
   {
     "method": "__init__",
     "action": "/home/[your user name]/.alphavantage config file found"
   }
   ```

   #### Example log during client.global_quote(...) call. The data property is the raw response from alpha vantage api:

   ```
   {
     "method": "get_data_from_alpha_vantage",
     "action": "response_from_alphavantage",
     "status_code": 200,
     "data": "{\n    \"Global Quote\": {\n        \"01. symbol\": \"TSLA\",\n        \"02. open\": \"712.4050\",\n        \"03. high\": \"738.2000\",\n        \"04. low\": \"708.2600\",\n        \"05. price\": \"737.1200\",\n        \"06. volume\": \"31923565\",\n        \"07. latest trading day\": \"2022-06-24\",\n        \"08. previous close\": \"705.2100\",\n        \"09. change\": \"31.9100\",\n        \"10. change percent\": \"4.5249%\"\n    }\n}"
   }
   ```

   #### Example log after converting response text into dictionary before returning to client:

   ```
   {
     "method": "get_data_from_alpha_vantage",
     "action": "return_value",
     "data": {
       "success": true,
       "limit_reached": false,
       "status_code": 200,
       "Global Quote": {
         "01. symbol": "TSLA",
         "02. open": "712.4050",
         "03. high": "738.2000",
         "04. low": "708.2600",
         "05. price": "737.1200",
         "06. volume": "31923565",
         "07. latest trading day": "2022-06-24",
         "08. previous close": "705.2100",
         "09. change": "31.9100",
         "10. change percent": "4.5249%"
       },
       "symbol": "tsla"
     }
   }
   ```

2. `logging.DEBUG` - This will get you all of the log statements from #1 and from the dependant libraries.
